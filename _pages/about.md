Hi! Iâ€™m Cailin.

I am a geophysics PhD student at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/earth/), being supervised by [Dr. Catherine Neish](https://planetneish.ca/). My main area of study is understanding the physical properties of lunar impact crater ejecta, using data from the [Diviner Lunar Radiometer](https://www.diviner.ucla.edu/) and the [Mini-RF instrument](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/main/), both of which are onboard the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

You can read my CV [here](https://cgallinger.github.io/_pages/Gallinger_CV_2023_June_v3.pdf).

I'm also on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/europamilkshake) and [medium](https://cailingallinger.medium.com/).
