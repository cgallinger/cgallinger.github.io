As some of you [may recall](https://cgallinger.github.io/blog/intersectional-introspection), I'm not exactly great at balancing TA duties with all the other parts of being a Ph.D. student even at the best of times. Therefore, this is mostly going to be a compendium of what _not_ to do, based on my own many past failures, and hopefully this year I'll finally be able to take my own advice!

1. **Don't wait to start grading assignments.** Yes, you're probably a little burnt out after running a lab section or holding office hours or (blah), but if you have any time available at all you should start grading labs/essays/assignments the same day students start to hand them in. This will both help you get through them faster (as you've just been engaging with the material and so won't need as much time to remember any details about the assignment), and also lighten the load on future-you, especially since not all students will hand in their assignments at the same time.

2. **Don't wait until you're already overwhelmed to reach out for help.** Your prof, your fellow TAs, and even the department admin staff are there to help make your life easier, and all of them are more than willing to work with you when the going gets tough. You should definitely start by seeing if you can resolve issues with your fellow TAs, and then escalate to the course instructor if necessary (department admins are probably only going to be involved with issues of academic misconduct or teacher/student disputes)

And to balance out all those negatives, here are a few brief positive suggestions as well (that I'm also hoping I can take):

1. **_Do_ treat your students with respect!** Without mentioning names (ahem), in general students will show you the same level of respect back that you show them. They're still human, after all, and if you ever feel yourself getting jaded towards people sending too many emails asking about their assignments or trying to copy each others' work in their lab sections, just remember what it was like when all of this was new for you as well.

2. In that same vein, **try to put yourself in your students' shoes.** While the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge) plagues us all, and there is admittedly no simple remedy, your teaching can always be improved by trying to imagine the perspective of someone approaching the subject for the first time. And if you find yourself having trouble envisioning this accurately, **get feeback**! Whether officially through course feedback surveys, or informally by just asking students what topics or concepts they're confused about, it makes all the difference in the world to be receptive and adaptable to the challenges of those you're trying to help.

3. **Blow off steam.** While bearing in mind point 1, we're still only human, and working with your other TAs together in the same room to grade assignments or put together course materials can be a great way to get out any exasperation or frustration without having to make it the problem of your students. They don't have to see it, you and your coworkers can have a little laugh, and hopefully you can keep yourself energized and motivated enough to re-approach the whole endeavour with a little more empathy afterwards.
