So, I guess it's time to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Or should I say, the truck.

I've been watching the events of the past two weeks unfold from afar, somewhat detached from them as---for once---the people waving Trump flags and wearing MAGA hats weren't marching down _my_ street about it. But I sincerely believe that, as informed citizens as well as academics, we have a responsibility to keep our heads out of the clouds and pay attention to the issues affecting broader society, and to use what knowledge and skills we have to contribute to solving them. Hence, this post.

It's been a whirlwind of reaction and counter-reaction throughout the past two weeks, as members of the anti-vaccine-mandate "Freedom Convoy" [first descended on Ottawa](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/downtown-ottawa-roads-businesses-shut-down-as-freedom-convoy-protesters-flood-parliament-hill-1.5759563), then were condemned for [defacing the Terry Fox statue and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/01/29/officials-decry-desecration-of-monuments-during-ottawa-protest.html) and [intimidating staff at a local soup kitchen](https://www.narcity.com/ottawa/an-ottawa-soup-kitchens-staff-was-reportedly-harassed-by-protesters-wanting-food), then were reported to be seen waving [Confederate and Nazi flags](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-premier-heather-stefanson-condemns-hate-images-deplorable-1.6334461), which were then [promptly decried as false flag attempts](https://pressprogress.ca/anti-vax-convoy-leader-says-he-welcomes-protesters-displaying-confederate-flags-in-ottawa/) to discredit the movement, until [additional revelations came out that members of QAnon may be behind the whole thing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/canada-ottawa-trucker-protest-extremist-qanon-neo-nazi).

There have been many signs from the beginning that this is not, in fact, a grassroots movement of long-haul transportation workers standing up to a restriction that is harming their livelihoods. In fact, the complaints don't even really make sense, as the vaccine "mandate" is only necessary if cross-boarder truckers want to avoid a 14-day quarantine, and similar restrictions have been [imposed from the US side of the border](https://www.businessinsider.com/truckers-vaccine-mandate-drivers-crossing-us-border-biden-2021-11) anyway. No one is _making_ anyone get a vaccine if they don't want to---there are just reasonable precautions in place now to reduce cross-border transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The fact that [over 90% of Canada's truck drivers are vaccinated](https://globalnews.ca/news/8533779/truckers-convoy-canada-vaccine-mandate/) and that the majority of the protestors in the convoys are not actually truckers themselves is scarcely mentioned anywhere amongst the ranks of the anti-vax crowd.

Still, conservatives (both big and small 'c') and posts on social media would have you believe we're living in an authoritarian state, where people are being forced against their will to receive a "dangerous" and "experimental" vaccine that will poison us all or, worse, make us mindless zombies under scary evil Justin Trudeau's control (made all the more repugnant by the Ottawa protestors wearing yellow stars, as if there were any remotely reasonable comparison to be made while they continue to occupy and shut down an entire city seemingly without consequence.)

Phrased this way, the hyperbole is obvious; but still, there have been people even amongst my friends and family who have been wary of the COVID vaccines, citing milder versions of the concerns above. Are they right to be? After all, [there _have_ been examples of government medical abuses in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study) where citizens were lied to and experimented on against their will. (One may note, however, the conspicuous difference in the skin colour of the affected people in those studies vs. the majority of the protestors in the current event.)

While I don't think I'm anywhere near good enough of a writer or charismatic enough of a personality to say anything about the protests that hasn't already been said better somewhere else, I _do_ think I have a fairly adept capacity to dig through mountains of boring scientific papers in order to find actual citations for the supposed claims people make about the vaccines---both for and against---and be able to present them in context. So without further ado, let's dive in, hennies:

I'm going to go through several of the claims on the [CDC's Myths and Facts about COVID-19 website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html), since they're good jumping off points to examine each claim more closely. To start with: 

## Are COVID-19 vaccines dangerous?

While the pace of development of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines has been unprecedented, the technologies underlying them have been in development for years. In addition to this

Additionally, to speed up the process of testing and approval for the vaccines, the normal double-blind clinical trial phases that all new drugs and treatments go through were overlapped with one another. This allowed results of the clinical trials to be available within a single year, instead of the multiple years most drugs take to get through this process.

Importantly, despite the overlap in trial phases, _no tests or steps were skipped in the vaccine approval process_. These vaccines all passed the necessary safety requirements, with a very large sample size and multiple potential at-risk groups encompassed to determine the range of side effects. This process is explained well in this other video from Vox (don't be afraid based on the title, however!):

## But what about pregnant people?
