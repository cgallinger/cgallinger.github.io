## Prologue

Humans have a strange relationship with the natural environment we live in. For thousands of years, our ancestors were beholden to its sway; they lived and died by the blessing of calm seas, or mild winters, or a chance encounter with a migrating herd of game. We invented agriculture, and even then were beholden to the whims of the Earth: enough sunlight to grow the crops, enough rain to replenish the irrigation reservoirs, a hiatus in floods or earthquakes or volcanic eruptions long enough to build and re-build the infrastructure of civilization.

In the present day, we find ourselves largely disconnected from this natural rhythm, flooded as we are by the blue melatonin-disrupting light of our screens at all hours, with roofs and walls to keep out the elements and food never more than a few taps away.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Assuming, of course, one finds themselves lucky enough to afford these luxuries of late-stage capitalism, unlike almost [a fifth of all Canadians](https://proof.utoronto.ca/food-insecurity/how-many-canadians-are-affected-by-household-food-insecurity/) who were food-insecure in 2022, and [almost a third of all Indigenous people](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus/5170-homelessness-how-does-it-happen) who will experience homelessness at some point in their lives.</span></span> Yet despite this sensory deadening, there are still a few phenomena so rare and unusual that they can shake us out of our stupor and reconnect us with these long-forgotten feelings.

Just over a week ago, along with [over 2 million other people](https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/statistics), three friends and I set out on a journey to catch one of these miraculous experiences. The April 8, 2024 eclipse was one I'd been silently, ecstatically anticipating ever since my first encounter with one back in 2017. In August of that year, just before starting my Masters degree, I'd been fortunate enough to be invited to a team meeting for the spacecraft instrument<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">yep, good ol' [Diviner](https://www.diviner.ucla.edu/)</span></span> I would be working with for my thesis project, which was held at a time and place to coincide with this otherworldly occasion.

The story of that day is long and slightly hilarious in its near-failure, but in short, the group I was with got lost on our way to meet the rest of the team at our previously-scouted eclipse-viewing location, and ended up after much struggle hitting a dead-end on the backcountry fire road we were taking. So, we made the best of a bad situation, whipped out a bluetooth speaker, and set up camp:

I'd gone into this adventure almost completely unprepared, sort of just following along with my supervisor on the trip. Sure, I'd seen pictures of eclipses online, the classic pitch-black disk link a pool of ink surrounded by the angelic glow of the solar corona. But the experience on the ground, as a person witnessing this profound transformation of your surroundings? To be honest, I hadn't really even thought about it.

And then totality hit.

I've described it many times since as the closest I've ever felt to G-d, a childhood of wonder and fascination with the natural world playing like a dozen fast-forwarding tapes simultaneously in my mind, as everything collapsed and was reborn again in that brief instant of the Sun's end. It's nearly impossible to explain in a way that conveys its true impact and awe, and becomes all the more frustrating when it then gets shrugged off as "oh yeah, I've seen pictures of those before" to people you try to talk about it with afterwards.

Thankfully, there are always a few nerds I can count on to understand the significance of these cosmically-improbable events, even if they don't always connect with the more spiritual and mystical aspects like I did. So six and a half years later, satellite cloud-cover maps in hand and trunk loaded with deli products, we set off for the next great North American eclipse.

## The Big Day

It had been a full weekend of sun and clear blue skies just before, so we were hopeful it would hold despite the pessimistic forecast. Unfortunately, this is what I woke up to on the morning of:

![image-center](/assets/images/24-04-17/20240408_102123.jpg){: .align-center .width-threequarter}

Undeterred, we pressed on, praying the predictions that the clouds would clear up by the afternoon would be borne out. We left London around 10 am, well before even the partial was scheduled to start, in case we hit traffic on the (nominally) 1.5-hour journey to the site. Our destination was [Sand Hill Park](https://sandhillpark.com/), a privately-owned trailer park and beach site near Long Point on the north shore of Lake Erie. We chose this site after a couple weeks of research, scouting for areas that had the best combination of proximity to the center of the path of totality, ease of access to the lake, and elevation above the surrounding terrain for maximum eclipse-set visibility. Sand Hill Park ticked all the boxes: it is an incredibly unique and unusual feature, a series of giant natural sand dunes right along the shore of the lake, formed by eons of southwesterly winds eroding and transporting material to this spot. But the scale of this dune is difficult to impress: it stands over _100 meters_ (350 feet) tall, the height of a **ten-story building**.

The week before the eclipse, Andrew and Jess went to scout out the site and see if, despite the park normally being closed until May 1, we could obtain entry just for that one afternoon. The owners, to their indelible credit, said that as long as it was just our small group coming they'd let us in for free (admission is normally $12/person), and as we found out later even allowed several other local groups to join as well. Truly, in all of Canada that day I think we had the best seat in the house:

Now that we'd beaten the traffic, had some lunch, and secured our spot, there was nothing left to do but wait. Here's a few shots over the course of the next hour as the Sun slowly, sloooowly started to disappear...:

And then the shadow appeared on the horizon, darkening the already ominous clouds whisking by over the south shore. This is why we'd wanted to stay elevated: during my first encounter with the Vanishing Sun, totality practically pounced upon us without warning, as the surrounding coastal hills made it difficult to see any distance away. This time, hundreds of feet above a flat lake over which the Moon's umbra was crawling, we couldn't miss it. It got closer, and the light got dimmer, and dimmer, until...

Once again I was awe-struck by the moment far more than I expected to be, and this time I wasn't alone. We all whooped and hollared and "wow"-ed and started frantically commenting on every unbelievable thing we were witnessing. When something this powerful happens, try as you might to hold your intellectual faculties together and take it all in as a natural consequence of Newtonian mechanics, something breaks and you can do nothing but surrender yourself to the incomparable beauty of creation. Andrew managed to capture the "diamond ring" just before totality, and a spectacular view of part of the 360-shadow-induced sunset:

</figure>

![image-center](/assets/images/24-04-17/IMG_6531.jpg){: .align-center .width-threequarter}

Of course, amongst all this we had to get in a very important group pose as well:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/24-04-17/IMG_6527.jpg" alt="Check the time-lapse for the behind-the-scenes of this once-in-a-lifetime snap, lol" caption="" %}

In all too brief of a moment, it was over. The sky brightened, shouts of "glasses!" were called out as people scrambled to put their filtering specs back on, and the world returned to the warm sunny day it had just been (well, almost---the Sun still 99% blocked and thus leaving things significantly colder).

We stayed for a while at the park to wait out the other visitors who immediately left, feeling like those weirdos who stay to watch the credits of a non-Marvel movie. But it gave us a chance to finish the food we'd brought, make sure everyone had a chance to relieve themselves after so much waiting up on the sand, and then get moving at a comfortable pace. We would've had a leisurely drive back after that, except that I, fool that I am, had booked a bus only a few short hours from then leaving Toronto that would take me overnight all the way out to Rochester, where I was _supposed_ to be observing the eclipse from<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">Sorry Ashka!</span></span> at a workshop I'd registered for months before. So, along with thousands of others, we hit the road and managed to scrape into Union Station with only minutes to spare.

<figure class="half">

</figure>

It was a long, cold ride that night, but I couldn't stop smiling the whole way, still burning with joy from the day before. This will probably be the last total eclipse I see for quite a while, if not the rest of my life---and I couldn't have imagined spending it with any better group of people, any other way. ♡

Till next moon,
