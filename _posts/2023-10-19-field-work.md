With the air finally starting to have a real chill, and the sun disappearing well before evening, fall has finally arrived here in [redacted] London, Ontario. Although I'm notoriously a winter-hater, the dread of that encroaching season hasn't _quite_ reached my limbic system yet, so for now I'm still able to appreciate some of the nice things about the one we're currently in. It's certainly a season awash with memory for me, and today I'd like to talk about a couple of the academic experiences it reminds me of.

It was just two years ago, in early October of 2021, that I found myself packed into a car with three other Western students<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">(hi Ashka and Taylor!)</span></span> on our way up to the city of Sudbury, Ontario, heading towards the first field course I'd signed up for in six years. [I've written briefly](https://cgallinger.github.io/blog/T+50-days/) about this experience before, but I think it's worthwhile to take some time and reflect on the significance it's had now that I'm a couple years out from it, better able to appreciate the embodied knowledge and impression it left on me.

While I was excited, I'm pretty sure my most frequently recurring thought during the whole 6 hour drive "what the hell have I gotten myself into?" The last time I had to put on hiking boots and a nylon jacket for a class I was just a baby undergrad, learning how to use geophysical field equipment for the first time in the relatively tame confines of a grassy cottage site near Deep River, Ontario. But now? This was the big leagues. We were going to look at _**rocks**_.

And not just any rocks! As I mentioned in the blog post from that time, this field course was specifically on impact cratering, and the geologic imprint it leaves behind on the Earth. In Canada, we are fortunate to have 31 of the world's 190 confirmed impact craters available for study, and of these Sudbury is by far the largest and most famous. Formed when a 10-15 km diameter meteor came screaming into the ancient supercontinent of Nuna 1.8 billion years ago, the Sudbury impact crater would have surpassed even the one that ended the age of dinosaurs off the Yucat√°n Peninsula 65 million years ago. Subsequent geologic processes (including the deformation related to forming large parts of the Canadian Shield) squashed the originally-circular 200-250 km diameter crater into its present 60-by-30 km oblong "beak" shape, contributing to the delay in recognizing its impact origin for many decades. Here, we find preserved (and unlike in Yucat√°n, _exposed_) both the massive amount of new rock created by the energy of the impact and subsequent melting/brecciation, as well as its effects on the surrounding terranes that include widespread evidence of immense shock pressures.

It was this incredible evidence that was the focus of our field course for the week we spent up there. Every morning, we would wake up and head down to our hotel's conference room for a one-hour lecture on impact crater geology, followed by a day trip out to one of the many locations where the Sudbury impact structure exposes its destructive record. One excursion took us on a path directly across the short axis of the current basin, allowing us to travel "up" through the folded and distorted layers of the Sudbury Igneous Complex, the massive sheet of impact melt rock created in the cataclysmic collision that remained molten for more than ten thousand years afterwards. This extremely long timescale of cooling allowed the melt sheet to chemically "differentiate" into different rock types as different minerals crystallized out at different temperatures---a unique feature of this extraordinary impact not recorded anywhere else in the world.

The other main component of our field course, aside from learning about the general geology and physical processes that produced the rocks we were seeing, was a group mapping project where we were tasked with making measurements on intriguing deposits of material injected into the pre-existing country rock that are known as "Sudbury Breccia". Although I technically have a "Masters in Earth Science", this was the _very first time_ I actually had to create a geologic map based on observations in the field, and I was grateful for my more hard-rock-geology-inclined group members to understand what exactly we were looking at.

I think the major impression I took away from the Sudbury impact course, much like previous field experiences, was the relationship between the simplified mental models we're taught about the processes that shape our Earth (and the other planets) and how these processes actually manifest in reality. As ever in science, all models are only useful insofar as they allow our limited human intellect to grasp the fundamentals of how nature operates, sectioning the infinitely-complex and tangled web of interactions at scales from the atomic to the astrophysical into well-defined categories. Crucially, however, in employing such models we must not lose sight of the fact that these are _human_ inventions and simplifications that nature is not beholden to, and to that end I think field work is an incredibly important part of getting our minds beyond the textbook and into the real world. 

At the end of the day, for all self-purported our "logic" and "scientific rigour", we are still creative apes who crave a narrative structure to make sense of the world around us. Personally, I think this is in fact one of the great benefits of the artificial constructs of models and taxonomy, as it takes what would otherwise be an endless sea of physical chaos and allows us to narrow in on the specific mechanisms having the greatest influence on its overall form. A good friend of mine, Andrew Siwabessy, has written an [excellent paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2020.105121) critical of some aspects of this endeavour, where these stories can lead us astray into ignoring or rejecting evidence which contradicts their core narrative, and I largely agree that this is a danger of such simplifications. But field work is at least a step towards grounding these stories in an embodied reality, one that we can refer to whenever we try to visualize the inhumanly-slow and monumental forces that move continents and raise mountains.




As we crossed hills and valleys to scout out a field location, occasionally cresting a barren peak to be greeted by the kaleidoscopic painting of the deciduous autumn forest punctured by hills of two-billion-year-old rock stretching in all directions, there were times when I was brought back those exhilarating first experiences I had witnessing the vast and majestic expression of our planet's ancient, relentless engine of creation and destruction. The fact we can take these few, precious gifts sent up from the dark and imposing interior of our planet, and then turn them into an understanding of processes operating thousands of times longer than any of us will ever live to experience, is to me one of the great enduring fascinations of geology.

## Post-script: a trans geologist's lament

One thing I've felt fortunate about in considering my past field experiences is the rarity of having to camp outdoors for them. When I was younger, camping was a fun adventure, a chance to put skills from childhood pastimes like fort building into practical use and shake up the routine of everyday life. But as I got older, the rough-and-tumble nature of having to carry your accommodations, food, and all other essentials with you became less and less appealing. I'd like to say this was simply because I became soft due to my urbanista lifestyle, but the truth is actually a little sadder: transitioning when I was 19 significantly increased the barrier to feeling comfortable in these environments. As much as I'd like to pretend that a decade of hormones and other transition-related actions have solidified my confidence in my gender being recognized by others, the truth is that this is still a tightrope I walk every single day, eating up large chunks of my time and energy. Camping, therefore, is one of the most harrowing environments for me to be in now, as it makes my usual daily rituals of feminine battle-armour construction difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve.

The most distressing of these, and the one that I'm hoping to finally solve within the next year, is the need to shave every single day, as HRT alone does nothing to stop the onslaught of coarse hair that has plagued my face since puberty. In addition, the close, against-the-grain shave necessary to hide this grotesque anomaly also leads to razor burn, which then necessitates a lengthy round of makeup application to neutralize and cover it up. For cis people, letting these natural bodily processes take over is just a part of the camping experience---away from civilization for a few days, everyone becomes a little rougher version of themselves by the time they return. But for me, and I'm sure other trans women like me, it's a significant disruption to our very sense of self, another trait that, if not managed in some way, will radically mark us as "other". And this is not even to mention the fact that often the smaller, rural places that field work takes place in are also those that are less than likely to hold positive attitudes towards gender- or sexuality-non-conforming presentations.
