The great annual gathering of this planet's planet scientists concluded a week ago, and although three of our lab members attended this year, I was not among them. However, there are still a few updates I can share about contributions I had to projects presented by other people last week, as well as a few observations about abstracts I thought looked interesting, so in this blog post, let's dive into those!




Till next time,
