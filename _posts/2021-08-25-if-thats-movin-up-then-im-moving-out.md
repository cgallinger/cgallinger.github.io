Gonna be a short one today in all honesty, and the title may give you some clue as to why (no, not 'cause Billy's only 5' 5"). As of this past weekend, I'm officially a Londoner! Unfortunately, I've had to specify to my more worldly friends that I mean the southern Ontario town, but it's been pretty nice here so far. Within a few days of moving, I've taken the bus around town, visited some of the vintage stores in the area, explored the park outside my apartment (although not yet the river!), and gotten takeout at more places than I dare to name.

Turning your whole life upside down, packing it into boxes, unpacking, and setting it all up again has been a lot more stressful than I anticipated, and I already knew it was going to be stressful. Since I was 18 I moved almost every single year, until the last place I lived in - there, I got a blissful 3-year reprieve, and was just starting to feel like I'd made myself a home. To be honest, if the responses to this post I made on facebook are any indication, I've actually been pretty lucky as far as unstable apartment-hopping queers go:
